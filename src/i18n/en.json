    "desc2": "A group of young and daring artists who created the first private gallery in the USSR in 1988 laid down two principles that have become unchanging for M'ARS: (1) to introduce the public to the newest and most advanced in contemporary art and (2) to provide its venues to a wide range of contemporary artists, leaving Time and the Viewer to judge and choose.",
    "desc3": "What is happening today in the world of visual culture? We see that traditional art is 'losing its sacredness', that the powerful visual pleasure offered by graphic design displaces art from its positions, and that technologies of virtual and augmented reality attract the viewer's attention.",
    "desc4": "M'ARS strives to rekindle the public's interest in art, proving that art and new technologies are not mutually exclusive concepts, and on the contrary, the use of new technologies in art creates an incomparable sensory and emotional experience.",
